/*
 * 
 * A PriorityQueue is used when the objects are supposed to be processed based on the priority. 
 * It is known that a queue follows First-In-First-Out algorithm, 
 * but sometimes the elements of the queue are needed to be processed according to the priority,
 * thatâ€™s when the PriorityQueue comes into play. 
 * The PriorityQueue is based on the priority heap. 
 * The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to the natural ordering,
 * or by a Comparator provided at queue construction time, 
 * depending on which constructor is used
 *
