It is a special form of Association where:

It represents Has-Aâ€™s relationship.
It is a unidirectional association i.e. a one-way relationship. For example, a department can have students but vice versa is not possible
and thus unidirectional in nature.
In Aggregation, both entries can survive individually which means ending one entity will not affect the other entity.
